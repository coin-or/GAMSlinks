introduction
GAMS/OS brings the open source Optimization Services project to the broad audience of GAMS users.
The code has been written primarily by Horand Gassmann, Jun Ma, and Kipp Martin.
The GAMS interface for OS is maintained by Stefan Vigerske, Humboldt University, in a COIN-OR project called GAMSlinks.

solver
Specifies the solver that is used to solve an instance.
Valid values are Clp, Cbc, Glpk, Ipopt, Bonmin, Couenne, none.
If 'none' is specified, then solving is skipped. This value is only valid for a local solve. 


service
Specifies the URL of an Optimization Services Server.
If specified, then this server is contacted and the service method specified under service_method is executed.
Note that by default the server executes CBC to solve an instance.
You can change the solver with the solver option.


service_method
Specifies the method to execute on a server.


service_method.'solve'
Specifies that an OS server should solve the provided instance and return the result.
CoinOS will wait until the OS server returns the result.


service_method.send
Specifies that the model instance is send to an OS server and the server should solve this instance.
CoinOS does not wait until the OS server returns the result but returns when submission of the instance is completed.


service_method.retrieve
Specifies that an optimization result should be requested from an OS server.
You should specify an OSoL file containing the JobID by using the readosol option.


service_method.getJobID
Specifies that an available Job identifier should be requested from an OS server. 
 

service_method.knock
Specifies that the status of a solve process is requested from an OS server.
The knock service method requires an OSpL file as input, see option readospl.


service_method.kill
Specifies that a solve process should be interrupted on an OS server.
You should specify an OSoL file containing the JobID by using the readosol option.


writeosil
Specifies the name of a file in which the GAMS model instance should be writting in OSiL format.


writeosrl
Specifies the name of a file in which the result of a solve process (solution, status, ...) should be writting in OSrL format.
 

readosol
Specifies the name of an option file in OSoL format that is given to the solver or an OS server.


readospl
Specifies the name of an OSpL file to use for the knock method.


writeospl
Specifies the name of an OSpL file in which the answer from the knock or kill method is written.

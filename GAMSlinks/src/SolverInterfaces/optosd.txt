introduction
GAMS/OS brings the open source Optimization Services (OS) project to the broad audience of GAMS users.
The code has been written primarily by Horand Gassmann, Jun Ma, and Kipp Martin.
The GAMS interface for OS is maintained by Stefan Vigerske, Humboldt University, in a COIN-OR project called GAMSlinks.

service
Specifies the URL of an Optimization Services Server.
The GAMS model is converted into OSiL format, send to the server, and the result translated back into GAMS format.
Note that by default the server chooses a solver that is appropriate to the model type.
You can change the solver with the solver option.


solver
Specifies the solver that is used to solve an instance on the OS server.


writeosil
Specifies the name of a file in which the GAMS model instance should be writting in OSiL format.


writeosrl
Specifies the name of a file in which the result of a solve process (solution, status, ...) should be writting in OSrL format.
 

readosol
Specifies the name of an option file in OSoL format that is given to the OS server.
This way it is possible to pass options directly to the solvers interfaced by OS.

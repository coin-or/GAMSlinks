introduction
GAMS/OS brings the open source Optimization Services project to the broad audience of GAMS users.
The code has been written primarily by Horand Gassmann, Jun Ma, and Kipp Martin.
The GAMS interface for OS is maintained by Stefan Vigerske, Humboldt University, in a COIN-OR project called GAMSlinks.

solver
Specifies the solver that is used to solve an instance.
Valid values are clp, cbc, glpk, ipopt, bonmin, couenne, none.
If 'none' is specified, then solving is skipped. This value is only valid for a local solve. 


service
Specifies the URL of an Optimization Services Server.
If specified, then this server is contacted and the service method specified under service_method is executed.
Note that by default the server chooses a solver that is appropriate to the model type.
You can change the solver with the solver option.


writeosil
Specifies the name of a file in which the GAMS model instance should be writting in OSiL format.


writeosrl
Specifies the name of a file in which the result of a solve process (solution, status, ...) should be writting in OSrL format.
 

readosol
Specifies the name of an option file in OSoL format that is given to the solver or an OS server.
This way it is possible to pass options directly to the COIN-OR solvers interfaced by OS.


readospl
Specifies the name of an OSpL file to use for the knock method.


writeospl
Specifies the name of an OSpL file in which the answer from the knock or kill method is written.

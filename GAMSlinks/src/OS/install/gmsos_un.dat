*   special = yz : each decimal "bit" is a separate flag
*              z : howExpected
*                :   z = 0  ->   unexpected: treat as missing if not complete
*                :   z = 1  ->     expected: warn if licensed and not complete
*                :   z > 1  ->     expected: warn if not complete
*             y  : howHidden
*                :   y = 0  ->   not hidden
*                :   y = 1  ->   should not be made default solver
*                :   y > 1  ->   not shown as available
*     for example, special = 20 is good for experimental stuff, as
*     this will quietly ignore the solver if it isn't there and hide
*     it from people who don't need to see it.

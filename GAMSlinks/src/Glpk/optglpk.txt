introduction
GAMS/CoinGlpk brings the open source LP/MIP solver Glpk from the GNU Open Software foundation to the broad audience of GAMS users.
The code has been written primarily by A. Makhorin.
The GAMS interface for Glpk is maintained by Stefan Vigerske, Humboldt University, in a COIN-OR project called GAMSlinks.
The interface uses the OSI Glpk interface written by Vivian De Smedt and Braden Hunsaker.<BR>

writemps
Write an MPS problem file.
The parameter value is the name of the MPS file.


cuts
Regulates the use of cut generator routines for the root problem.<BR>
If set to automatic, then the parameters for the single cut generators determine which are added.


gomorycuts
This options switches the generation of mixed integer Gomory Cuts on.


covercuts
This options switches the generation of mixed cover cuts on.


cliquecuts
This options switches the generation of clique cuts on.


startalg
This option determines whether a primal or dual simplex algorithm should be used to solve the root node.


scaling
This option determines the method how the constraint matrix is scaled.


pricing
Sets the pricing method for both primal and dual simplex.


tol_dual
Absolute tolerance used to check if the current basis solution is dual feasible.
(Glpk manual: Do not change this parameter without detailed understanding its purpose.)


tol_primal
Relative tolerance used to check if the current basis solution is primal feasible.
(Glpk manual: Do not change this parameter without detailed understanding its purpose.)


tol_integer
Absolute tolerance used to check if the current basis solution is integer feasible.
(Glpk manual: Do not change this parameter without detailed understanding its purpose.)


backtracking
Determines which method to use for the backtracking heuristic.



reslim_fixedrun
Maximum time in seconds for solving the MIP with fixed discrete variables.


reslim
Maximum time in seconds.


iterlim
Maximum number of simplex iterations.
Set this option to -1 to switch off an iteration limit.


optcr
Relative optimality criterion for a MIP.
Glpk uses this parameter as relative tolerance to check if the value of the objective function is not better than in the best known integer feasible solution.

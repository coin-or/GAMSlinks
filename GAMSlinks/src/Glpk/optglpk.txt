introduction
GAMS/CoinGlpk brings the open source LP/MIP solver Glpk from the
GNU Open Software foundation to the broad audience of GAMS users. The
code has been written primarily by A. Makhorin. The GAMS interface
for Glpk is maintained by Stefan Vigerske, Humboldt University, in a
COIN-OR project called GAMSlinks. For more information visit the web site

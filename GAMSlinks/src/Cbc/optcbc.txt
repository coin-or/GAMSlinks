introduction
GAMS/CoinCBC brings the open source LP/MIP solver Cbc from the COIN-OR
foundation to the broad audience of GAMS users. Cbc (COIN-OR branch
and cut) is an open-source mixed integer programming solver. Cbc is a
branch and cut code working with the COIN-OR LP solver Clp. The code
has been written primarily by John J. Forrest, who is the COIN-OR
project leader for Cbc. The GAMS interface for Cbc is maintained by
Stefan Vigerske, Humboldt University, in a separate COIN-OR project
called GAMSLinks. For more information visit the web site for <a

redsplitcuts
Reduce-and-Split cuts are variants of Gomory cuts: Starting from the
current optimal tableau, linear combinations of the rows of the
current optimal simplex tableau are used for generating Gomory
cuts. The choice of the linear combinations is driven by the objective
of reducing the coefficients of the non basic continuous variables in
the resulting row.

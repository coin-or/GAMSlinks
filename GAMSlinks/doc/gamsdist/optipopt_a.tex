\subsubsection{Output}

\paragraph{print\_level:} Output verbosity level. $\;$ \\
 Sets the default verbosity level for console
output. The larger this value the more detailed
is the output. The valid range for this integer option is
$0 \le {\tt print\_level } \le 11$
and its default value is $4$.


\paragraph{print\_user\_options:} Print all options set by the user. $\;$ \\
 If selected, the algorithm will print the list of
all options set by the user including their
values and whether they have been used.
The default value for this string option is ``no''.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item no: don't print options
   \item yes: print options
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{print\_options\_documentation:} Switch to print all algorithmic options. $\;$ \\
 If selected, the algorithm will print the list of
all available algorithmic options with some
documentation before solving the optimization
problem.
The default value for this string option is ``no''.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item no: don't print list
   \item yes: print list
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{output\_file:} File name of desired output file (leave unset for no file output). $\;$ \\
An output file with this
name will be written (leave unset for no file
output).  The verbosity level is by default set
to ``print\_level'', but can be overridden with
``file\_print\_level''.  The file name is changed
to use only small letters.
With the default settings no output file is generated.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item *: Any acceptable standard file name
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{file\_print\_level:} Verbosity level for output file. $\;$ \\
 NOTE: This option only works when read from the
ipopt.opt options file! Determines the verbosity
level for the file specified by ``output\_file''.
By default it is the same as ``print\_level''. The valid range for this integer option is
$0 \le {\tt file\_print\_level } \le 11$
and its default value is $4$.

\subsubsection{Termination}

\paragraph{tol:} Desired convergence tolerance (relative). $\;$ \\
 Determines the convergence tolerance for the
algorithm.  The algorithm terminates
successfully, if the (scaled) NLP error becomes
smaller than this value, and if the (absolute)
criteria according to ``dual\_inf\_tol'',
``primal\_inf\_tol'', and ``cmpl\_inf\_tol'' are met.
 (This is $\varepsilon_\mathrm{tol}$ in Eqn. (6) in the
implementation paper).  See also
``acceptable\_tol'' as a second termination
criterion.  Note, some other algorithmic features
also use this quantity to determine thresholds
etc. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt tol } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $1 \cdot 10^{-08}$.

\paragraph{s\_max:} Scaling threshold for the NLP error. $\;$ \\
The valid range for this integer option is
$0 \le {\tt s\_max } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $100$.

\paragraph{max\_iter:} Maximum number of iterations. $\;$ \\
 The algorithm terminates with an error message if
the number of iterations exceeded this number. The valid range for this integer option is
$0 \le {\tt max\_iter } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is the value of the GAMS parameter iterlim, which default value is $10000$.


\paragraph{compl\_inf\_tol:} Desired threshold for the complementarity conditions. $\;$ \\
 Absolute tolerance on the complementarity.
Successful termination requires that the max-norm
of the (unscaled) complementarity is less than
this threshold. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt compl\_inf\_tol } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $0.0001$.


\paragraph{constr\_viol\_tol:} Desired threshold for the constraint violation. $\;$ \\
 Absolute tolerance on the constraint violation.
Successful termination requires that the max-norm
of the (unscaled) constraint violation is less
than this threshold. The default value for this real option is $0.0001$ and its
valid range is $0<\texttt{constr\_viol\_tol}<{\tt +inf}$.


\paragraph{dual\_inf\_tol:} Desired threshold for the dual infeasibility. $\;$ \\
 Absolute tolerance on the dual infeasibility.
Successful termination requires that the max-norm
of the (unscaled) dual infeasibility is less than
this threshold. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt dual\_inf\_tol } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $0.0001$.


\paragraph{acceptable\_tol:} ``Acceptable'' convergence tolerance (relative). $\;$ \\
 Determines which (scaled) overall optimality
error is considered to be ``acceptable''. There are
two levels of termination criteria.  If the usual
``desired'' tolerances (see tol, dual\_inf\_tol
etc) are satisfied at an iteration, the algorithm
immediately terminates with a success message. 
On the other hand, if the algorithm encounters
``acceptable\_iter'' many iterations in a row that
are considered ``acceptable'', it will terminate
before the desired convergence tolerance is met.
This is useful in cases where the algorithm might
not be able to achieve the ``desired'' level of
accuracy. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt acceptable\_tol } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $1 \cdot 10^{-06}$.

\paragraph{acceptable\_iter:} Number of ``acceptable'' iterates before triggering termination. $\;$ \\
If the algorithm encounters this many successive ``acceptable'' iterates (see ``acceptable\_tol''), it terminates, assuming that the problem has been solved to best possible accuracy given round-off.
If it is set to zero, this heuristic is disabled.
The valid range for this integer option is
$0 \le {\tt acceptable\_iter } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $15$.

\paragraph{acceptable\_compl\_inf\_tol:} ``Acceptance'' threshold for the complementarity conditions. $\;$ \\
 Absolute tolerance on the complementarity.
``Acceptable'' termination requires that the
max-norm of the (unscaled) complementarity is
less than this threshold; see also
acceptable\_tol. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt acceptable\_compl\_inf\_tol } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $0.01$.


\paragraph{acceptable\_constr\_viol\_tol:} ``Acceptance'' threshold for the constraint violation. $\;$ \\
 Absolute tolerance on the constraint violation.
``Acceptable'' termination requires that the
max-norm of the (unscaled) constraint violation
is less than this threshold; see also
acceptable\_tol. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt acceptable\_constr\_viol\_tol } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $0.01$.


\paragraph{acceptable\_dual\_inf\_tol:} ``Acceptance'' threshold for the dual infeasibility. $\;$ \\
 Absolute tolerance on the dual infeasibility.
``Acceptable'' termination requires that the
(max-norm of the unscaled) dual infeasibility is
less than this threshold; see also
acceptable\_tol. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt acceptable\_dual\_inf\_tol } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $0.01$.


\paragraph{diverging\_iterates\_tol:} Threshold for maximal value of primal iterates. $\;$ \\
 If any component of the primal iterates exceeded
this value (in absolute terms), the optimization
is aborted with the exit message that the
iterates seem to be diverging. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt diverging\_iterates\_tol } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $1 \cdot 10^{+20}$.

\subsubsection{NLP Scaling}

\paragraph{obj\_scaling\_factor:} Scaling factor for the objective function. $\;$ \\
 This option sets a scaling factor for the
objective function. The scaling is seen
internally by Ipopt but the unscaled objective is
reported in the console output. If additional
scaling parameters are computed (e.g.
user-scaling or gradient-based), both factors are
multiplied. The valid range for this real option is 
${\tt -inf} <  {\tt obj\_scaling\_factor } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $1$.


\paragraph{nlp\_scaling\_method:} Select the technique used for scaling the NLP. $\;$ \\
 Selects the technique used for scaling the
problem internally before it is solved. For
user-scaling, the parameters come from the values of the .scale suffix in GAMS.
The default value for this string option is ``gradient-based'' if scaleopt is 0 (default).
If the user provides variable or equation scaling values in GAMS and sets $<$model$>$.scaleopt to 1, then the default for this parameter is ``user-scaling''.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item none: no problem scaling will be performed
   \item user-scaling: scaling parameters will come from the user
   \item gradient-based: scale the problem so the maximum gradient at
the starting point is scaling\_max\_gradient
   \item equilibration-based: scale the problem so that first derivatives are
of order 1 at random points (only available with MC19)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{nlp\_scaling\_max\_gradient:} Maximum gradient after NLP scaling. $\;$ \\
 This is the gradient scaling cut-off. If the
maximum gradient is above this value, then
gradient based scaling will be performed. Scaling
parameters are calculated to scale the maximum
gradient back to this value. (This is $g_{\max}$ in
Section 3.8 of the implementation paper.) Note:
This option is only used if
``nlp\_scaling\_method'' is chosen as
``gradient-based''. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt nlp\_scaling\_max\_gradient } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $100$.

\paragraph{nlp\_scaling\_obj\_target\_gradient:} Target value for objective function gradient size. $\;$ \\
     If a positive number is chosen, the scaling factor the objective function
     is computed so that the gradient as the max norm of the given size at the
     starting point.  This overrides nlp\_scaling\_max\_gradient for the
     objective function.
The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt nlp\_scaling\_obj\_target\_gradient } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $0$.

\subsubsection{NLP corrections}

\paragraph{dependency\_detector:} Indicates which linear solver should be used to detect linearly dependent equality constraints. $\;$ \\
The default value for this string option is ``none''.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
\item none:                    don't check; no extra work at beginning
\item mumps:                   use MUMPS
\item ma28:                     use MA28
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{dependency\_detection\_with\_rhs:} Indicates if the right hand sides of the constraints should be considered during dependency detection. $\;$ \\
The default value for this string option is ``no''.\\
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
\item no:                      only look at gradients
\item yes:                     also consider right hand side
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{point\_perturbation\_radius:} Maximal perturbation of an evaluation point. $\;$ \\
     If a random perturbation of a points is required, this number indicates
     the maximal perturbation.  Currently, this is only used when we perturb
     the initial point in order to get a random Jacobian for the linear
     dependency detection of equality constraints.
The valid range for this real option is 
$0 \le {\tt point\_perturbation\_radius } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $10$.

\paragraph{kappa\_d:} Weight for linear damping term (to handle one-sided bounds). $\;$ \\
The valid range for this real option is 
$0 \le {\tt kappa\_d } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $10^{-5}$.

\paragraph{bound\_relax\_factor:} Factor for initial relaxation of the bounds. $\;$ \\
 Before start of the optimization, the bounds
given by the user are relaxed.  This option sets
the factor for this relaxation.  If it is set to
zero, then then bounds relaxation is disabled.
(See Eqn.(35) in the implementation paper.)
The valid range for this real option is 
$0 \le {\tt bound\_relax\_factor } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $0$.


\paragraph{honor\_original\_bounds:} Indicates whether final points should be projected into original bounds. $\;$ \\
 Ipopt might relax the bounds during the
optimization (see, e.g., option
``bound\_relax\_factor'').  This option determines
whether the final point should be projected back
into the user-provide original bounds after the
optimization.
The default value for this string option is ``yes''.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item no: Leave final point unchanged
   \item yes: Project final point back into original bounds
\end{itemize}

% \paragraph{check\_derivatives\_for\_naninf:} Indicates whether it is desired to check for Nan/Inf in derivative matrices $\;$ \\
%  Activating this option will cause an error if an
% invalid number is detected in the constraint
% Jacobians or the Lagrangian Hessian.  If this is
% not activated, the test is skipped, and the
% algorithm might proceed with invalid numbers and
% fail.
% The default value for this string option is ``no''.
% \\ 
% Possible values:
% \begin{itemize}
%    \item no: Don't check (faster).
%    \item yes: Check Jacobians and Hessian for Nan and Inf.
% \end{itemize}

\paragraph{fixed\_variable\_treatment:} Determines how fixed variables should be handled. $\;$ \\
The main difference between those options is that the starting point in the ``make\_constraint'' case still has the fixed variables at their given values, whereas in the case ``make\_parameter''
the functions are always evaluated with the fixed values for those variables. 
Also, for ``relax\_bounds'', the fixing bound constraints are relaxed (according to ``bound\_relax\_factor'').
For both ``make\_constraints'' and ``relax\_bounds'', bound multipliers are computed for the fixed variables.
The default value for this string option is ``make\_parameter''.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
\item make\_parameter:    Remove fixed variable from optimization variables.
\item make\_constraint:   Add equality constraints fixing variables.
\item relax\_bounds:      Relax fixing bound constraints.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Initialization}

\paragraph{bound\_frac:} Desired minimum relative distance from the initial point to bound. $\;$ \\
 Determines how much the initial point might have
to be modified in order to be sufficiently inside
the bounds (together with ``bound\_push'').
(This is $\kappa_2$ in Section 3.6 of the implementation paper.)
The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt bound\_frac } \le 0.5$
and its default value is $0.01$.


\paragraph{bound\_push:} Desired minimum absolute distance from the initial point to bound. $\;$ \\
 Determines how much the initial point might have
to be modified in order to be sufficiently inside
the bounds (together with ``bound\_frac'').
(This is $\kappa_1$ in Section 3.6 of the implementation paper.)
The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt bound\_push } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $0.01$.


\paragraph{slack\_bound\_push:} Desired minimum absolute distance from the initial slack to bound. $\;$ \\       Determines how much the initial slack variables might have to be modified
in order to be sufficiently inside the inequality bounds (together with ``slack\_bound\_frac'').
(This is $\kappa_1$ in Section 3.6 of the implementation paper.)
The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt slack\_bound\_push } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $0.01$.

\paragraph{slack\_bound\_frac:} Desired minimum relative distance from the initial slack to bound.
     Determines how much the initial slack variables might have to be modified
     in order to be sufficiently inside the inequality bounds (together with
     ``slack\_bound\_push'').
(This is $\kappa_2$ in Section 3.6 of the implementation paper.)
The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt slack\_bound\_frac } \le  0.5$
and its default value is $0.01$.


\paragraph{bound\_mult\_init\_val:} Initial value for the bound multipliers. $\;$ \\
 All dual variables corresponding to bound
constraints are initialized to this value. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt bound\_mult\_init\_val } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $1$.


\paragraph{constr\_mult\_init\_max:} Maximum allowed least-square guess of constraint multipliers. $\;$ \\
 Determines how large the initial least-square
guesses of the constraint multipliers are allowed
to be (in max-norm). If the guess is larger than
this value, it is discarded and all constraint
multipliers are set to zero.  This options is
also used when initializing the restoration
phase. By default,
``resto.constr\_mult\_init\_max'' (the one used in
RestoIterateInitializer) is set to zero. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 \le {\tt constr\_mult\_init\_max } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $1000$.


\paragraph{bound\_mult\_init\_val:} Initial value for the bound multipliers. $\;$ \\
 All dual variables corresponding to bound
constraints are initialized to this value. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt bound\_mult\_init\_val } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $1$.

\paragraph{least\_square\_init\_primal:} Least square initialization of the primal variables. $\;$ \\
     If set to yes, Ipopt ignores the user provided point and solves a least
     square problem for the primal variables (x and s), to fit the linearize
     equality and inequality constraints.  This might be useful if the user
     doesn't know anything about the starting point, or for solving an LP or
     QP.
The default value for this string option is ``no''.\\
   Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
    \item no:                      take user-provided point
    \item yes:                     overwrite user-provided point with least-square estimates
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{least\_square\_init\_duals:} Least square initialization of all dual variables. $\;$ \\
     If set to yes, Ipopt tries to compute least-square multipliers
     (considering ALL dual variables).  If successful, the bound multipliers
     are possibly corrected to be at least bound\_mult\_init\_val. This might be
     useful if the user doesn't know anything about the starting point, or for
     solving an LP or QP.
The default value for this string option is ``no''.\\
   Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
    \item no:                      use bound\_mult\_init\_val and least-square equality constraint multipliers
    \item yes:                     overwrite user-provided point with least-square estimates
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Barrier parameter update}

\paragraph{mehrotra\_algorithm:} Indicates if we want to do Mehrotra's algorithm. $\;$ \\
 If set to yes, Ipopt runs as Mehrotra's
predictor-corrector algorithm. This works usually
very well for LPs and convex QPs.  This
automatically disables the line search, and
chooses the (unglobalized) adaptive mu strategy
with the ``probing'' oracle, and uses
``corrector\_type=affine'' without any safeguards;
you should not set any of those options
explicitly in addition.  Also, unlessotherwise
specified, the values of ``bound\_push'',
``bound\_frac'', and ``bound\_mult\_init\_val'' are
set more aggressive, and sets
``alpha\_for\_y=bound\_mult''.
The default value for this string option is ``no''.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item no: Do the usual Ipopt algorithm.
   \item yes: Do Mehrotra's predictor-corrector algorithm.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{mu\_strategy:} Update strategy for barrier parameter. $\;$ \\
 Determines which barrier parameter update
strategy is to be used.
The default value for this string option is ``adaptive''.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item monotone: use the monotone (Fiacco-McCormick) strategy
   \item adaptive: use the adaptive update strategy
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{mu\_oracle:} Oracle for a new barrier parameter in the adaptive strategy. $\;$ \\
 Determines how a new barrier parameter is
computed in each ``free-mode'' iteration of the
adaptive barrier parameter strategy. (Only
considered if ``adaptive'' is selected for option
``mu\_strategy'').
The default value for this string option is ``quality-function''.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item probing: Mehrotra's probing heuristic
   \item loqo: LOQO's centrality rule
   \item quality-function: minimize a quality function
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{quality\_function\_max\_section\_steps:} Maximum number of search steps during direct search procedure determining the optimal centering parameter. $\;$ \\
 The golden section search is performed for the
quality function based mu oracle. The valid range for this integer option is
$0 \le {\tt quality\_function\_max\_section\_steps } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $8$.
This option is only used if the option ``mu\_oracle'' is set to ``quality-function''.


\paragraph{fixed\_mu\_oracle:} Oracle for the barrier parameter when switching to fixed mode. $\;$ \\
 Determines how the first value of the barrier
parameter should be computed when switching to
the ``monotone mode'' in the adaptive strategy.
(Only considered if ``adaptive'' is selected for
option ``mu\_strategy''.)
The default value for this string option is ``average\_compl''.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item probing: Mehrotra's probing heuristic
   \item loqo: LOQO's centrality rule
   \item quality-function: minimize a quality function
   \item average\_compl: base on current average complementarity
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{mu\_init:} Initial value for the barrier parameter. $\;$ \\
 This option determines the initial value for the
barrier parameter (mu).  It is only relevant in
the monotone, Fiacco-McCormick version of the
algorithm. (i.e., if ``mu\_strategy'' is chosen as
``monotone'') The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt mu\_init } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $0.1$.

\paragraph{mu\_max\_fact:} Factor for initialization of maximum value for barrier parameter. $\;$ \\
 This option determines the upper bound on the
barrier parameter.  This upper bound is computed
as the average complementarity at the initial
point times the value of this option. (Only used
if option ``mu\_strategy'' is chosen as ``adaptive''.) The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt mu\_max\_fact } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $1000$.


\paragraph{mu\_max:} Maximum value for barrier parameter. $\;$ \\
 This option specifies an upper bound on the
barrier parameter in the adaptive mu selection
mode.  If this option is set, it overwrites the
effect of mu\_max\_fact. (Only used if option
``mu\_strategy'' is chosen as ``adaptive''.) The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt mu\_max } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $100000$.


\paragraph{mu\_min:} Minimum value for barrier parameter. $\;$ \\
 This option specifies the lower bound on the
barrier parameter in the adaptive mu selection
mode. By default, it is set to
min(``tol'', ``compl\_inf\_tol'')/(``barrier\_tol\_fact-
or''+1), which should be a reasonable value. (Only
used if option ``mu\_strategy'' is chosen as
``adaptive''.) The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt mu\_min } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $1 \cdot 10^{-09}$.

\paragraph{barrier\_tol\_factor:} Factor for mu in barrier stop test. $\;$ \\
 The convergence tolerance for each barrier
problem in the monotone mode is the value of the
barrier parameter times ``barrier\_tol\_factor''.
This option is also used in the adaptive mu
strategy during the monotone mode. (This is
$\kappa_\varepsilon$ in the implementation paper). The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt barrier\_tol\_factor } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $10$.

\paragraph{mu\_linear\_decrease\_factor:} Determines linear decrease rate of barrier parameter. $\;$ \\
 For the Fiacco-McCormick update procedure the new
barrier parameter mu is obtained by taking the
minimum of mu$\cdot$``mu\_linear\_decrease\_factor'' and
mu$^\textrm{``superlinear\_decrease\_power''}$.  (This is
$\kappa_\mu$ in the implementation paper.) This option
is also used in the adaptive mu strategy during
the monotone mode. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt mu\_linear\_decrease\_factor } <  1$
and its default value is $0.2$.


\paragraph{mu\_superlinear\_decrease\_power:} Determines superlinear decrease rate of barrier parameter. $\;$ \\
 For the Fiacco-McCormick update procedure the new
barrier parameter mu is obtained by taking the
minimum of mu$\cdot$``mu\_linear\_decrease\_factor'' and
mu$^\textrm{``superlinear\_decrease\_power''}$.  (This is
$\theta_\mu$ in the implementation paper.) This option
is also used in the adaptive mu strategy during
the monotone mode. The valid range for this real option is 
$1 <  {\tt mu\_superlinear\_decrease\_power } <  2$
and its default value is $1.5$.

\subsubsection{Barrier parameter update (expert options)}

\paragraph{mu\_allow\_fast\_monotone\_decrease:} Allow skipping of barrier problem if barrier test is already met. $\;$ \\
 If set to ``no'', the algorithm enforces at least
one iteration per barrier problem, even if the
barrier test is already met for the updated
barrier parameter.
The default value for this string option is ``yes''.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item no: Take at least one iteration per barrier problem
   \item yes: Allow fast decrease of mu if barrier test it met
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{adaptive\_mu\_globalization:} Globalization strategy for the adaptive mu selection mode. $\;$ \\
 To achieve global convergence of the adaptive
version, the algorithm has to switch to the
monotone mode (Fiacco-McCormick approach) when
convergence does not seem to appear.  This option
sets the criterion used to decide when to do this
switch. (Only used if option ``mu\_strategy'' is
chosen as ``adaptive''.)
The default value for this string option is ``obj-constr-filter''.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item kkt-error: nonmonotone decrease of kkt-error
   \item obj-constr-filter: 2-dim filter for objective and constraint
violation
   \item never-monotone-mode: disables globalization
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{adaptive\_mu\_kkterror\_red\_iters:} Maximum number of iterations requiring sufficient progress. $\;$ \\
 For the ``kkt-error'' based globalization strategy,
the progress made in at most ``adaptive\_mu\_kkterror\_red\_iters'' iterations must be sufficient.
If this number of iterations is exceeded, the
globalization strategy switches to the monotone
mode. The valid range for this integer option is
$0 \le {\tt adaptive\_mu\_kkterror\_red\_iters } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $4$.


\paragraph{adaptive\_mu\_kkterror\_red\_fact:} Sufficient decrease factor for ``kkt-error'' globalization strategy. $\;$ \\
 For the ``kkt-error'' based globalization strategy,
the error must decrease by this factor to be
deemed sufficient decrease. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt adaptive\_mu\_kkterror\_red\_fact } <  1$
and its default value is $0.9999$.


\paragraph{filter\_margin\_fact:} Factor determining width of margin for obj-constr-filter adaptive globalization strategy. $\;$ \\
 When using the adaptive globalization strategy,
``obj-constr-filter'', sufficient progress for a
filter entry is defined as follows: (new obj) <
(filter obj) - filter\_margin\_fact$\cdot$ (new
constr-viol) OR (new constr-viol) $<$ (filter
constr-viol) - filter\_margin\_fact$\cdot$ (new
constr-viol).  For the description of the
``kkt-error-filter'' option see
``filter\_max\_margin''. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt filter\_margin\_fact } <  1$
and its default value is $1 \cdot 10^{-05}$.


\paragraph{filter\_max\_margin:} Maximum width of margin in obj-constr-filter adaptive globalization strategy. $\;$ \\
 The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt filter\_max\_margin } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $1$.


\paragraph{adaptive\_mu\_restore\_previous\_iterate:} Indicates if the previous iterate should be restored if the monotone mode is entered. $\;$ \\
 When the globalization strategy for the adaptive
barrier algorithm switches to the monotone mode,
it can either start from the most recent iterate
(no), or from the last iterate that was accepted
(yes).
The default value for this string option is ``no''.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item no: don't restore accepted iterate
   \item yes: restore accepted iterate
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{adaptive\_mu\_monotone\_init\_factor:} Determines the initial value of the barrier parameter when switching to the monotone mode. $\;$ \\
 When the globalization strategy for the adaptive
barrier algorithm switches to the monotone mode
and the option fixed\_mu\_oracle is chosen as
``average\_compl'', the barrier parameter is set to
the current average complementarity times the

\subsubsection{Warm start}

\paragraph{warm\_start\_init\_point:} Warm-start for initial point $\;$ \\

 This is only relevant if ``alpha\_for\_y'' is
chosen ``primal-and-full'' or ``dual-and-full''.  The
step size for the equality constraint multipliers
is taken to be one if the max-norm of the primal
step is less than this tolerance. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 \le {\tt alpha\_for\_y\_tol } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $10$.

\paragraph{recalc\_y:} Tells the algorithm to recalculate the equality and inequality multipliers as least square estimates. $\;$ \\
 This asks Ipopt to recompute the
multipliers, whenever the current infeasibility
is less than recalc\_y\_feas\_tol. Choosing yes
might be helpful in the quasi-Newton option. 
However, each recalculation requires an extra
factorization of the linear system.  If a limited
memory quasi-Newton option is chosen, this is
used by default.
The default value for this string option is ``no''.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item no: use the Newton step to update the multipliers
   \item yes: use least-square multiplier estimates
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{recalc\_y\_feas\_tol:} Feasibility threshold for recomputation of multipliers. $\;$ \\
 If recalc\_y is chosen and the current
infeasibility is less than this value, then the
multipliers are recomputed. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt recalc\_y\_feas\_tol } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $1 \cdot 10^{-06}$.

\subsubsection{Line search}

\paragraph{max\_soc:} Maximum number of second order correction trial steps at each iteration. $\;$ \\
 Choosing 0 disables the second order corrections.
(This is $p^{\max}$ of Step A-5.9 of Algorithm A in

and its default value is $4$.


\paragraph{watchdog\_shortened\_iter\_trigger:} Number of shortened iterations that trigger the watchdog. $\;$ \\
 If the number of successive iterations in which
the backtracking line search did not accept the
first trial point exceeds this number, the
watchdog procedure is activated.  Choosing 0
here disables the watchdog procedure. The valid range for this integer option is
$0 \le {\tt watchdog\_shortened\_iter\_trigger } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $10$.


\paragraph{watchdog\_trial\_iter\_max:} Maximum number of watchdog iterations. $\;$ \\
 This option determines the number of trial
iterations allowed before the watchdog procedure
is aborted and the algorithm returns to the
stored point. The valid range for this integer option is
$1 \le {\tt watchdog\_trial\_iter\_max } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $3$.

\paragraph{corrector\_type:} The type of corrector steps that should be taken (experimental!). $\;$ \\
 If ``mu\_strategy'' is ``adaptive'', this option
determines what kind of corrector steps should be
tried.
The default value for this string option is ``none''.
\\ 
Possible values:

the trial step size is reduced by this factor. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt alpha\_red\_factor } <  1$
and its default value is $0.5$.


\paragraph{accept\_every\_trial\_step:} Always accept the first trial step. $\;$ \\
 Setting this option to ``yes'' essentially disables
the line search and makes the algorithm take
aggressive steps, without global convergence
guarantees.
The default value for this string option is ``no''.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item no: don't arbitrarily accept the full step
   \item yes: always accept the full step
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{tiny\_step\_tol:} Tolerance for detecting numerically insignificant steps. $\;$ \\
 If the search direction in the primal variables
(x and s) is, in relative terms for each
component, less than this value, the algorithm
accepts the full step without line search.  If
this happens repeatedly, the algorithm will
terminate with a corresponding exit message. The
default value is 10 times machine precision. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 \le {\tt tiny\_step\_tol } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $2.22045 \cdot 10^{-15}$.


\paragraph{tiny\_step\_y\_tol:} Tolerance for quitting because of numerically insignificant steps. $\;$ \\
 If the search direction in the primal variables
(x and s) is, in relative terms for each
component, repeatedly less than tiny\_step\_tol,
and the step in the y variables is smaller than
this threshold, the algorithm will terminate. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 \le {\tt tiny\_step\_y\_tol } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $0.01$.


\paragraph{theta\_max\_fact:} Determines upper bound for constraint violation in the filter. $\;$ \\
 The algorithmic parameter theta\_max is
determined as theta\_max\_fact times the maximum
of 1 and the constraint violation at initial
point.  Any point with a constraint violation
larger than theta\_max is unacceptable to the
filter (see Eqn. (21) in the implementation paper). The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt theta\_max\_fact } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $10000$.


\paragraph{theta\_min\_fact:} Determines constraint violation threshold in the switching rule. $\;$ \\
 The algorithmic parameter theta\_min is
determined as theta\_min\_fact times the maximum
of 1 and the constraint violation at initial
point.  The switching rules treats an iteration
as an h-type iteration whenever the current
constraint violation is larger than theta\_min
(see paragraph before Eqn. (19) in the implementation
paper). The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt theta\_min\_fact } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $0.0001$.


\paragraph{eta\_phi:} Relaxation factor in the Armijo condition. $\;$ \\

\paragraph{gamma\_theta:} Relaxation factor in the filter margin for the constraint violation. $\;$ \\
 (See Eqn. (18b) in the implementation paper.) The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt gamma\_theta } <  1$
and its default value is $1 \cdot 10^{-05}$.


\paragraph{alpha\_min\_frac:} Safety factor for the minimal step size (before switching to restoration phase). $\;$ \\
 (This is $\gamma_\alpha$ in Eqn. (20) in the
implementation paper.) The default value of this real option is $0.05$ and its
valid range is $0 <  {\tt alpha\_min\_frac } <  1$.


\paragraph{kappa\_soc:} Factor in the sufficient reduction rule for second order correction. $\;$ \\
 This option determines how much a second order
correction step must reduce the constraint
violation so that further correction steps are
attempted.  (See Step A-5.9 of Algorithm A in
the implementation paper.) The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt kappa\_soc } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $0.99$.


\paragraph{obj\_max\_inc:} Determines the upper bound on the acceptable increase of barrier objective function. $\;$ \\
 Trial points are rejected if they lead to an
increase in the barrier objective function by
more than obj\_max\_inc orders of magnitude. The valid range for this real option is 
$1 <  {\tt obj\_max\_inc } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $5$.


\paragraph{max\_filter\_resets:} Maximal allowed number of filter resets $\;$ \\
 A positive number enables a heuristic that resets
the filter, whenever in more than
``filter\_reset\_trigger'' successive iterations
the last rejected trial steps size was rejected
because of the filter.  This option determine the
maximal number of resets that are allowed to take
place. The valid range for this integer option is
$0 \le {\tt max\_filter\_resets } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $5$.


\paragraph{filter\_reset\_trigger:} Number of iterations that trigger the filter reset. $\;$ \\
 If the filter reset heuristic is active and the
number of successive iterations in which the last
rejected trial step size was rejected because of
the filter, the filter is reset. The valid range for this integer option is
$1 \le {\tt filter\_reset\_trigger } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $5$.


% \paragraph{skip\_corr\_if\_neg\_curv:} Skip the corrector step in negative curvature iteration (unsupported!). $\;$ \\
%  The corrector step is not tried if negative
% curvature has been encountered during the
% computation of the search direction in the
% current iteration. This option is only used if
% ``mu\_strategy'' is ``adaptive''.
% The default value for this string option is ``yes''.
% \\ 
% Possible values:

%    \item yes: skip
% \end{itemize}

% \paragraph{skip\_corr\_in\_monotone\_mode:} Skip the corrector step during monotone barrier parameter mode (unsupported!). $\;$ \\
%  The corrector step is not tried if the algorithm
% is currently in the monotone mode (see also
% option ``barrier\_strategy'').This option is only
% used if ``mu\_strategy'' is ``adaptive''.
% The default value for this string option is ``yes''.
% \\ 
% Possible values:
% \begin{itemize}
%    \item no: don't skip
%    \item yes: skip
% \end{itemize}

% \paragraph{corrector\_compl\_avrg\_red\_fact:} Complementarity tolerance factor for accepting corrector step (unsupported!). $\;$ \\
%  This option determines the factor by which
% complementarity is allowed to increase for a
% corrector step to be accepted. The valid range for this real option is 
% $0 <  {\tt corrector\_compl\_avrg\_red\_fact } <  {\tt +inf}$
% and its default value is $1$.


\paragraph{kappa\_sigma:} Factor limiting the deviation of dual variables from primal estimates. $\;$ \\
 If the dual variables deviate from their primal
estimates, a correction is performed. (See Eqn.
(16) in the the implementation paper.) Setting the
value to less than 1 disables the correction. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 <  {\tt kappa\_sigma } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $1 \cdot 10^{+10}$.


\paragraph{slack\_move:} Correction size for very small slacks. $\;$ \\
 Due to numerical issues or the lack of an
interior, the slack variables might become very
small.  If a slack becomes very small compared to
machine precision, the corresponding bound is
moved slightly.  This parameter determines how
large the move should be.  Its default value is
mach\_eps$^{3/4}$.  (See also end of Section 3.5
in the implementation paper - but actual
the implementation might be somewhat different.) The valid range for this real option is 
$0 \le {\tt slack\_move } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $1.81899 \cdot 10^{-12}$.

\subsubsection{Restoration phase}

\paragraph{expect\_infeasible\_problem:} Enable heuristics to quickly detect an infeasible problem. $\;$ \\
 This options is meant to activate heuristics that
may speed up the infeasibility determination if
you expect that there is a good chance for the
problem to be infeasible.  In the filter line
search procedure, the restoration phase is called
more quickly than usually, and more reduction in
the constraint violation is enforced before the
restoration phase is left. If the problem is
square, this option is enabled automatically.
The default value for this string option is ``no''.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item no: the problem probably be feasible
   \item yes: the problem has a good chance to be infeasible
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{expect\_infeasible\_problem\_ctol:} Threshold for disabling ``expect\_infeasible\_problem'' option. $\;$ \\
 If the constraint violation becomes smaller than
this threshold, the ``expect\_infeasible\_problem''
heuristics in the filter line search are
disabled. If the problem is square, this options
is set to 0. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 \le {\tt expect\_infeasible\_problem\_ctol } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $0.001$.


\paragraph{start\_with\_resto:} Tells algorithm to switch to restoration phase in first iteration. $\;$ \\
 Setting this option to ``yes'' forces the algorithm
to switch to the feasibility restoration phase in
the first iteration. If the initial point is
feasible, the algorithm will abort with a failure.
The default value for this string option is ``no''.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item no: don't force start in restoration phase
   \item yes: force start in restoration phase
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{soft\_resto\_pderror\_reduction\_factor:} Required reduction in primal-dual error in the soft restoration phase. $\;$ \\
 The soft restoration phase attempts to reduce the
primal-dual error with regular steps. If the
damped primal-dual step (damped only to satisfy
the fraction-to-the-boundary rule) is not
decreasing the primal-dual error by at least this
factor, then the regular restoration phase is
called. Choosing 0 here disables the soft
restoration phase. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 \le {\tt soft\_resto\_pderror\_reduction\_factor } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $0.9999$.


\paragraph{required\_infeasibility\_reduction:} Required reduction of infeasibility before leaving restoration phase. $\;$ \\
 The restoration phase algorithm is performed,
until a point is found that is acceptable to the
filter and the infeasibility has been reduced by
at least the fraction given by this option. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 \le {\tt required\_infeasibility\_reduction } <  1$
and its default value is $0.9$.


\paragraph{max\_soft\_resto\_iters:} Maximum number of iterations performed successively in soft restoration phase. $\;$ \\
 If the soft restoration phase is performed for
more than so many iterations in a row, the regular
restoration phase is called. The valid range for this integer option is
$0 \le {\tt max\_soft\_resto\_iters } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $10$.


\paragraph{max\_resto\_iter:} Maximum number of successive iterations in restoration phase. $\;$ \\
 The algorithm terminates with an error message if
the number of iterations successively taken in
the restoration phase exceeds this number. The valid range for this integer option is
$0 \le {\tt max\_resto\_iter } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $3000000$.


\paragraph{bound\_mult\_reset\_threshold:} Threshold for resetting bound multipliers after the restoration phase. $\;$ \\
 After returning from the restoration phase, the
bound multipliers are updated with a Newton step
for complementarity.  Here, the change in the
primal variables during the entire restoration
phase is taken to be the corresponding primal
Newton step. However, if after the update the
largest bound multiplier exceeds the threshold
specified by this option, the multipliers are all
reset to 1. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 \le {\tt bound\_mult\_reset\_threshold } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $1000$.


\paragraph{constr\_mult\_reset\_threshold:} Threshold for resetting equality and inequality multipliers after restoration phase. $\;$ \\
 After returning from the restoration phase, the
constraint multipliers are recomputed by a least
square estimate.  This option triggers when those
least-square estimates should be ignored. The valid range for this real option is 
$0 \le {\tt constr\_mult\_reset\_threshold } <  {\tt +inf}$
and its default value is $0$.


\paragraph{evaluate\_orig\_obj\_at\_resto\_trial:} Determines if the original objective function should be evaluated at restoration phase trial points. $\;$ \\
 Setting this option to ``yes'' makes the
restoration phase algorithm evaluate the
objective function of the original problem at
every trial point encountered during the
restoration phase, even if this value is not
required.  In this way, it is guaranteed that the
original objective function can be evaluated
without error at all accepted iterates; otherwise
the algorithm might fail at a point where the
restoration phase accepts an iterate that is good
for the restoration phase problem, but not the
original problem.  On the other hand, if the
evaluation of the original objective is
expensive, this might be costly.
The default value for this string option is ``yes''.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item no: skip evaluation
   \item yes: evaluate at every trial point
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Linear solver}

\paragraph{linear\_solver:} Linear solver used for step computations. $\;$ \\
 Determines which linear algebra package is to be used for the solution of the augmented linear system (for obtaining the search directions).

Specify the path to a PARDISO library that and can be load via dynamic linking, see also \hyperlink{ipoptlinearsolver}{Section \ref{ipoptlinearsolver}}.

\paragraph{linear\_system\_scaling:} Method for scaling the linear system. $\;$ \\
 Determines the method used to compute symmetric scaling factors for the augmented system (see also the ``linear\_scaling\_on\_demand'' option).
This scaling is independent of the NLP problem scaling.
By default, MC19 is only used if MA27 or MA57 are selected as linear solvers.
% This option is only available if Ipopt has been compiled with MC19.
The default value for this string option is ``mc19''.
\\
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item none: no scaling will be performed
   \item mc19: use the Harwell routine MC19
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{linear\_scaling\_on\_demand:} Flag indicating that linear scaling is only done if it seems required. $\;$ \\
 This option is only important if a linear scaling method (e.g., mc19) is used.
If you choose ``no'', then the scaling factors are computed for every linear system from the start.
This can be quite expensive.
Choosing ``yes'' means that the algorithm will start the scaling method only when the solutions to the linear system seem not good, and then use it until the end.
The default value for this string option is ``yes''.
\\
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item no: Always scale the linear system.
   \item yes: Start using linear system scaling if solutions
seem not good.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{fast\_step\_computation:} Indicates if the linear system should be solved quickly. $\;$ \\
 If set to yes, the algorithm assumes that the
linear system that is solved to obtain the search
direction, is solved sufficiently well. In that
case, no residuals are computed, and the
computation of the search direction is a little
faster.
The default value for this string option is ``no''.
\\ 
Possible values:
\begin{itemize}
   \item no: Verify solution of linear system by computing
residuals.
   \item yes: Trust that linear systems are solved well.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{max\_refinement\_steps:} Maximum number of iterative refinement steps per linear system solve. $\;$ \\
 Iterative refinement (on the full unsymmetric

\subsubsection{Hessian perturbation}

\paragraph{max\_hessian\_perturbation:} Maximum value of regularization parameter for handling negative curvature. $\;$ \\
 In order to guarantee that the search directions
are indeed proper descent directions, Ipopt
requires that the inertia of the (augmented)
linear system for the step computation has the
correct number of negative and positive
eigenvalues. The idea is that this guides the
algorithm away from maximizers and makes Ipopt
more likely converge to first order optimal
points that are minimizers. If the inertia is not
correct, a multiple of the identity matrix is
added to the Hessian of the Lagrangian in the
augmented system. This parameter gives the
maximum value of the regularization parameter. If
a regularization of that size is not enough, the
algorithm skips this iteration and goes to the
restoration phase. (This is $\delta_w^{\max}$ in the

and its default value is $0.0001$.


\paragraph{perturb\_inc\_fact\_first:} Increase factor for x-s perturbation for very first perturbation. $\;$ \\

first perturbation and allows a different value
for for the first perturbation than that used for
the remaining perturbations. (This is

 (This is $\kappa_c$ in the implementation paper.) The default value for this real option is $0.25$
and its valid range is $0 \le {\tt jacobian\_regularization\_exponent } <  {\tt +inf}$.


\paragraph{perturb\_always\_cd:} Active permanent perturbation of constraint linearization. $\;$ \\

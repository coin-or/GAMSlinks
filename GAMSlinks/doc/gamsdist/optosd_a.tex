\subsection{Detailed Descriptions of CoinOS Options}

\begin{description}

\item[\label{readosol}\hypertarget{readosol}
{\textbf{readosol (\slshape{string})}}]\hspace{1.0in}

Specifies the name of an option file in OSoL format that is given to the solver or an OS server.


\item[\label{writeosil}\hypertarget{writeosil}
{\textbf{writeosil (\slshape{string})}}]\hspace{1.0in}

Specifies the name of a file in which the GAMS model instance should be writting in OSiL format.


\item[\label{writeosrl}\hypertarget{writeosrl}
{\textbf{writeosrl (\slshape{string})}}]\hspace{1.0in}

Specifies the name of a file in which the result of a solve process (solution, status, ...) should be writting in OSrL format.


\item[\label{service}\hypertarget{service}
{\textbf{service (\slshape{string})}}]\hspace{1.0in}

Specifies the URL of an Optimization Services Server.
If specified, then this server is contacted and the service method specified under service\_method is executed.
Note that by default the server executes CBC to solve an instance.
You can change the solver with the solver option.


\item[\label{service_method}\hypertarget{service_method}
{\textbf{service\_method (\slshape{string})}}]\hspace{1.0in}

Specifies the method to execute on a server.

\textsl{(default = solve)}
\begin{itemize}
\item[solve] 
Specifies that an OS server should solve the provided instance and return the result.
CoinOS will wait until the OS server returns the result.
\item[getJobID] 
Specifies that an available Job identifier should be requested from an OS server.
\item[knock] 
Specifies that the status of a solve process is requested from an OS server.
The knock service method requires an OSpL file as input, see option readospl.
\item[kill] 
Specifies that a solve process should be interrupted on an OS server.
You should specify an OSoL file containing the JobID by using the readosil option.
\item[send] 
Specifies that the model instance is send to an OS server and the server should solve this instance.
CoinOS does not wait until the OS server returns the result but returns when submission of the instance is completed.
\item[retrieve] 
Specifies that an optimization result should be requested from an OS server.
You should specify an OSoL file containing the JobID by using the readosil option.
\end{itemize}

\item[\label{solver}\hypertarget{solver}
{\textbf{solver (\slshape{string})}}]\hspace{1.0in}

Specifies the solver that is used to solve an instance.
Valid values are Clp, Cbc, Glpk, Ipopt, Bonmin, Couenne.


\item[\label{readospl}\hypertarget{readospl}
{\textbf{readospl (\slshape{string})}}]\hspace{1.0in}

Specifies the name of an OSpL file to use for the knock method.


\item[\label{writeospl}\hypertarget{writeospl}
{\textbf{writeospl (\slshape{string})}}]\hspace{1.0in}

Specifies the name of an OSpL file in which the answer from the knock or kill method is written.

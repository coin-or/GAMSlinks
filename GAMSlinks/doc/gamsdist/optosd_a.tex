\item[\label{readosol}\hypertarget{readosol}
{\textbf{readosol (\slshape{string})}}]\hspace{1.0in}

Specifies the name of an option file in OSoL format that is given to the OS server.
This way it is possible to pass options directly to the solvers interfaced by OS.


\item[\label{writeosil}\hypertarget{writeosil}
{\textbf{writeosil (\slshape{string})}}]\hspace{1.0in}

Specifies the name of a file in which the GAMS model instance should be writting in OSiL format.


\item[\label{writeosrl}\hypertarget{writeosrl}
{\textbf{writeosrl (\slshape{string})}}]\hspace{1.0in}

Specifies the name of a file in which the result of a solve process (solution, status, ...) should be writting in OSrL format.


\item[\label{service}\hypertarget{service}
{\textbf{service (\slshape{string})}}]\hspace{1.0in}

Specifies the URL of an Optimization Services Server.
The GAMS model is converted into OSiL format, send to the server, and the result translated back into GAMS format.
Note that by default the server chooses a solver that is appropriate to the model type.
You can change the solver with the solver option.


\item[\label{solver}\hypertarget{solver}
{\textbf{solver (\slshape{string})}}]\hspace{1.0in}

Specifies the solver that is used to solve an instance on the OS server.

These directories contain links between the GAMS modeling system (http://www.gams.com) and some open source solvers.

For requirements and installation instruction see the file INSTALL in the GAMSlinks base directory.
For information on how to use the installed solvers in GAMS and which parameters are supported, see the COIN-OR solver documentation part from the GAMS solver manuals, located in doc/gamsdist (compile ind_coin.tex with pdflatex).
For license information see the file LICENSE.

=== Introduction ===

Currently for the following solvers links are available:
* Cbc:    Coin Branch and Cut code
* Ipopt:  Interior Point Optimizer
* Bonmin: Basic open-source nonlinear mixed-integer programming
* Osi:    LP and MIP solvers with a COIN-OR/OSI interface (this link has not been tested much)
* OS:     Optimization Services (call a remote Optimization Server or use solvers linked to OS locally)
* SCIP:   MIP solver of the Branch and Cut Framework from Zuse-Institut Berlin

There are known to work under Linux (32 and 64 bit), Windows (32 bit), Solaris Intel (64 bit), and Intel Darwin.

=== Parameters ===

The GAMS/COIN-OR solvers implement a subset of all possible GAMS parameters.
Not all bells and whistles of regular GAMS solvers are part of the interfaces yet.
For nonstandard solver parameters that can be set, see
- the documentation in doc/gamsdist
- src/Cbc/optcbc.gms,
- the IPOPT documentation,
- the Bonmin documentation,
- src/Osi/optosi.gms,
- src/OS/optosi.gms.

=== Tests ===

The directory test contains a script that tests Cbc, Ipopt, Bonmin, Osi, and SCIP on small testsuites from the GAMS test model library (testlib).

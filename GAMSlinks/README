These directories contain links between the GAMS modeling system (http://www.gams.com) and some COIN-OR and other solvers.

For requirements and installation instruction see the file INSTALL in the GAMSlinks base directory.
For information on how to use the installed solvers in GAMS and which parameters are supported, see the GAMS documentation.
For license information see the file LICENSE.

=== Introduction ===

Currently for the following solvers links are available:
* Cbc:    Coin Branch and Cut code
* Ipopt:  Interior Point Optimizer
* Bonmin: Basic open-source nonlinear mixed-integer programming
* Couenne: Convex Over and Under Envelopes for Nonlinear Estimation; global MINLP solver
* Osi:    LP and MIP solvers with a COIN-OR/OSI interface, in particular Cplex, Gurobi, Mosek, Xpress
* OS:     Optimization Services (call a remote Optimization Server or write out the instance in OSiL format)
* SoPlex: LP solver developed at Zuse-Institut Berlin
* SCIP:   MIP and MINLP solver of the Branch and Cut Framework SCIP

=== Parameters ===

The GAMS/COIN-OR solvers implement a subset of all possible GAMS parameters.
Not all bells and whistles of regular GAMS solvers are part of the interfaces yet.
For nonstandard solver parameters that can be set, see the GAMS solvers documentations
(https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/S_MAIN.html).

=== Tests ===

The directory test contains a script that tests Cbc, Ipopt, Bonmin, Couenne, Osi, SoPlex, and SCIP on small testsuites from the GAMS test model library (testlib).

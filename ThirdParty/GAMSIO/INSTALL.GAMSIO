Installation of precompiled GAMSIO libraries.

Depending on the platform you are working on, you need different libraries.
Currently supported are

- LX3: 32bit AMD- or Intel-based Linux systems with the 2.3 C libraries.
- LEI: 64bit AMD- or Intel-based (x86_64) Linux systems with the 2.3 C libraries.
- VIS: Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and compatible on AMD- or Intel-based (x86) architectures.
- SIG: Solaris 10.0 or higher on a x86 (64 bit only) machine.
- DII: Intel-based (x86) Macintosh system with Darwin.

The precompiled libraries are present in the current directory.
In a previous version, we had here some script and instructions to download them from the GAMS server.

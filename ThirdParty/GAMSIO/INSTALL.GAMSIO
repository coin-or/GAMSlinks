Installation of precompiled GAMSIO libraries.

Depending on the platform you are working on, you need different libraries.
Currently supported are

- LX3: 32bit AMD- or Intel-based Linux systems with the 2.3 C libraries.
- LEI: 64bit AMD- or Intel-based (x86_64) Linux systems with the 2.3 C libraries.
- VIS: Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and compatible on AMD- or Intel-based (x86) architectures.
- SIG: Solaris 10.0 or higher on a x86 (64 bit only) machine.
- DII: Intel-based (x86) Macintosh system with Darwin.

If you are working under Unix/Linux-like system and you have `wget'
installed, you can downloaded the required libraries
by executing the script get.GAMSIO in this directory with the corresponding system code as parameter, e.g.
  ./get_GAMSIO LX3
If you are not sure which system code is right for you, you can also call this script with several parameter or no parameter.
If no parameter is given, the script tries to determine the system code according to the output of uname.
If it fails to determine the system code, libraries for all available systems are downloaded. 

If the script does not work for you, follow the following instructions:

Create a directory which name is the code that corresponds to your machine
(e.g., LX3 for Linux 32bit, VIS for Windows, ...).

download the file <syscode>_latest.tgz into the created directory, where <syscode> is the system code in lower case letters.
Then unpack this file:
  tar xzf <syscode>_latest.tgz

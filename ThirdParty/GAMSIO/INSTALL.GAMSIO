Installation of precompiled GAMSIO libraries.

Depending on the platform you are working on, you need different libraries.
Currently supported are

- LX3: 32bit AMD- or Intel-based Linux systems with the 2.3 C libraries.
- LEI: 64bit AMD- or Intel-based (x86_64) Linux systems with the 2.3 C libraries.
- VIS: Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and compatible on AMD- or Intel-based (x86) architectures.
- SIG: Solaris 10.0 or higher on a x86 (64 bit only) machine.
- DII: Intel-based (x86) Macintosh system with Darwin.

If you are working under Unix/Linux-like system and you have `wget'
installed, you can downloaded the required libraries
by executing the included get-script in this directory.

Otherwise, follow those instructions:

Create a directory which name is the code that corresponds to your machine
(e.g., LX3 for Linux 32bit, VIS for Windows, ...).

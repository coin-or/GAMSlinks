Installation of SCIP subroutines within COIN-OR.

**********************************************************************

If you agree with the SCIP licence terms, then you may download SCIP at

http://scip.zib.de

and unpack it in this directory:

gunzip scip-1.00.tgz
tar xf scip-1.00.tar

Then you need to rename the directory
  scip-1.00
into
  scip
.

Optionally, you can put a symbolic link named scip to your scip sources.

To have the SCIP/CLP interface work properly, you need to apply the patch scip.patch in this directory by calling

    patch -p0 < scip.patch


Finally you add the line

#include <limits.h>

at the beginning of scip/src/tclique/tclique_branch.c .


To compile the GAMS/SCIP interface, you currently might need to switch
off some compiler warnings by adding

ADD_CXXFLAGS="-Wno-unknown-pragmas -Wno-long-long"

to your configure call.
If you use the GNU compiler, then this is already taken care of.
For the Intel 9 compiler this seem to be not necessary.

Compling in Windows with Intel compilers failed due to assert statements before local member declarations.
In case you run into this trouble, remove the asserts at

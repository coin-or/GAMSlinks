You may download SCIP by following the links at

http://www.zib.de

and unpack it in this directory:

gunzip scip-1.00.tgz
tar xf scip-1.00.tar

Then you need to rename the directory
  scip-1.00
into
  scip
.

Finally you add the line

#include <limits.h>

at the beginning of scip/src/tclique/tclique_branch.c .

To compile the GAMS/SCIP interface, you currently need to switch
off some compiler warnings by adding

ADD_CXXFLAGS="-Wno-unknown-pragmas -Wno-long-long"

to your configure call.

If you agree with the SCIP licence terms, then you may download SCIP at

http://scip.zib.de

and unpack it in this directory:

gunzip scip-1.1.0.tgz
tar xf scip-1.1.0.tar

Further, download the bugfix for the SCIP/CLP interface from

  http://scip.zib.de/download/bugfixes/scip-1.1.0/lpi_clp.cpp

and put it into scip-1.1.0/src/scip (overwrite the original lpi_clp.cpp there).

Then you need to rename the directory
  scip-1.1.0
into
  scip
.

Optionally, you can put a symbolic link named scip to your scip sources.

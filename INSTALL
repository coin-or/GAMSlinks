= Main installation steps =

 1. Install a GAMS system, if you do not have one.
 2. Download third-party software.
 3. Call configure, make, and make install.
 4. Install the GAMS/COIN-OR links in your GAMS system by calling make gams-install.

= Detailed instructions =

== 1. Installation of a GAMS system ==

A GAMS system is needed to build the GAMS solver interfaces.

You can download a GAMS demonstration system at http://www.gams.com/latest.
The demonstrations limits are:
 * Number of constraints: 300
 * Number of variables: 300
 * Number of nonzero elements: 2000 (of which 1000 nonlinear)
 * Number of discrete variables: 50 (including semi continuous, semi integer and member of SOS-Sets)

== 2. Download third-party software. ==

Several solvers require third-party software, e.g., for linear algebra or matrix ordering.
Also to build interfaces for SoPlex and SCIP, these solvers need to be made available.
Go through the directories in directory ThirdParty/ to check which third-party software you need
and make the source code available. For some packages, a get.* script to download the code is
available. For others, follow the instructions in INSTALL.

== 3. Configure and make COIN-OR/GAMS links ==

We suggest to compile the code in a different place than the one where the source code is located using the VPATH feature of the build system.

Now you can use the GAMSlinks build system.
That is, you just call
 1. configure
 2. make
 3. make install

This should setup the Makefiles, compile all COIN-OR packages and install binaries for the COIN-OR/GAMS links in the subdirectory bin.

If a GAMS system is found in the search path, it will automatically be found by the GAMSlinks configure script.
Alternatively you can provide a path with the --with-gams option of configure.

== 4. Installation of solvers in your GAMS system ==

By calling "make gams-install", the GAMS system is made aware of the build solver interfaces.

To use a solver under GAMS, use SOLVER=MY<SolverName>, e.g., use SOLVER=MYCBC to call your build of the GAMS/Cbc link.
The prefix "MY" has been added to distinguish the solvers from those that are already included in the GAMS distribution.
